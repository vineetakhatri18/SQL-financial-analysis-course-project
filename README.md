# SQL financial analysis course project

## Project Summary:
Atliq Hardwares, a prominent computer hardware producer based in India, faced a challenge in obtaining timely and insightful data for informed decision-making. To address this, the company initiated a project focused on SQL Advanced: Finance Analytics. The project comprised 10 lectures, with a specific focus on generating comprehensive reports and analyses to support executive management in making quick and informed decisions.

### Tool Used:
The primary tool employed for this project was SQL, a powerful relational database management system. SQL's capabilities were harnessed to extract, transform, and analyze data related to Atliq Hardwares' financial transactions and sales performance.

### Functions Used:
The project extensively utilized various SQL functions to derive meaningful insights. Notably, user-defined SQL functions were implemented to tailor specific analyses to the company's unique requirements. 
- SQL functions such as aggregations (e.g., SUM) 
- window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK) played a crucial role in dissecting and summarizing the financial data.

### Insights:
The project aimed to provide insights into key areas, starting with a Gross Sales Report that detailed monthly product transactions and total sales amounts. Additionally, a focus on yearly sales reports allowed for a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance over an extended period.

Stored procedures were employed to automate the generation of monthly gross sales reports, streamlining the process for executive management. Another critical aspect was the creation of a Market Badge procedure, identifying top markets and customers to pinpoint areas of strength and opportunity.

The project also delved into identifying top products through targeted exercises. Window functions, particularly the OVER clause, were explored to enhance the analytical capabilities of the SQL queries. Exercises involving ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK further demonstrated the power of window functions in gaining granular insights into the data.

In conclusion, the project not only addressed Atliq Hardwares' immediate need for insightful financial analytics but also equipped the executive management with essential skills in SQL. The combination of user-defined functions, stored procedures, and window functions provided a robust framework for ongoing data analysis and decision-making in the consumer goods industry.
